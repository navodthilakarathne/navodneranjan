<h2>Assembly of the Infant Microbiome</h2>
<br>
The goals of this project include improving our understanding of the microbes that colonize infants at birth, as well as the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape those communities as they mature into stable, resilient communities later in life.

<h2>Heritable Features in the Salivary Microbiome</h2>
<br>
Through a collaboration with the [Department of Twins Research](http://twinsuk.ac.uk/) at King's College, London, I am identifying heritible features of the salivary microbiome.

<h2>The Microbiome in Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h2>
<br>
Very Early-Onset Inflammatory Bowel Disease (VEO-IBD) is chronic and recurrent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract diagnosed in children under the age of 6.<br>
<br>
The disease that develops in these very young patients often differs from older children or adults, both in terms of its tissue involvement and severity, making diagnosis and treatment more difficult. Furthermore, VEO-IBD patients often donâ€™t respond to therapies used in adult IBD.<br>
<br>
The communities of bacteria that live in in the gut of small children often have different composition than those that live in adults, and these differences could impact VEO-IBD disease course, as well as how they respond to treatment. Therefore, we are exploring the role of the oral and intestinal microbiome in this rare childhood disease which will pave the way for better diagnostics and treatments. <br>
