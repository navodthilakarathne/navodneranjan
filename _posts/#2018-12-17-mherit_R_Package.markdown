I'm currently developing an R package called [<code>mherit</code>](https://danielsprockett.github.io/mherit/), which will facilitate calculating the heritability of 16S rRNA amplicon datasets.  

My approach is similar to the analyses in performed [Goodrich <i>et al.</i> (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414012410) and [Goodrich <i>et al.</i> (2016)](https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(16)30153-6), but I hope to expand those pipelines and make the entire process more reproducible. 

This is my first package that is meant for use by the wider research community, so feedback is very welcome! You can check it out [here](https://danielsprockett.github.io/mherit/).
