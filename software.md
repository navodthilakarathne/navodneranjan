<h1>R Packages</h1>

<h3><code>mherit</code> - Microbiome Heritability</h3> 

I'm currently developing an R package called [<code>mherit</code>](https://danielsprockett.github.io/mherit/), which will facilitate calculating the heritability of 16S rRNA amplicon datasets.  

You can check it out [here](https://danielsprockett.github.io/mherit/).

<h3><code>tyRa</code> - Build Models</h3>

[<code>tyRa</code>](https://github.com/DanielSprockett/tyRa) is an R package I made to streamline modeling complex systems in the microbiome. Current functionality is limited, but many more data-cleaning, modeling, and plotting functions are planned. Feel free to make suggestions. 

Learn more [here](https://danielsprockett.github.io/tyRa/).

<h3><code>reltools</code> - R Tools for the Relman Lab</h3>

[<code>reltools</code>](https://github.com/DanielSprockett/reltools) is an R package that I created to facilitate the analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon datasets by members of the Relman lab. It was not intended for widespread use, although some people may find it useful.

You can install it [here](https://github.com/DanielSprockett/reltools).
